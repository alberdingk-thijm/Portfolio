NOTE: Please make sure that passwords.txt and patient_records.txt are in the data/data/com.group_0862.triage/files/ directory before launching the app.

Our app opens to a list with four options:
1) Look up a patient, where you can search a patient's health card number and retrieve their information and records,
2) Create new visit, which adds a new visit record for a patient,
3) Update information, where you can select a patient from those currently in the hospital and update their information, and
4) Save changes, which saves all of the changes made in the current session.

Thank you for using Triage application!
